# IEEE_754_CONVERTER
The modules suppiles the convertion from integer with fractions to IEEE_754 represetation, including multiply, add and substarct
for IEEE 754 numbers

More generally, the "customized" modules provides the algorithm for any bit width montissa (increase significant bits) so that improve precision
